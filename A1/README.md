# Assignment 1 Support Code

This is the support code for COMP3702 2024 Assignment 1 (BeeBot).

The following files are provided:

**environment.py**

This file contains a class representing a game environment and supporting helper methods. You should make use of this 
class in your solver.

This file contains a number of functions which will be useful in developing your solver:

~~~~~
__init__(filename)
~~~~~
Constructs a new instance based on the given input filename.


~~~~~
get_init_state()
~~~~~
Returns a State object (see below) representing the initial state of the level.


~~~~~
perform_action(state, action)
~~~~~
Simulates the outcome of performing the given 'action' starting from the given 'state', where 'action' is an element of
GameEnv.ACTIONS and 'state' is a State object. Returns a tuple of whether the action was successful (i.e. valid and
collision free), the cost of performing the action, and the resulting new state


~~~~~
is_solved(state)
~~~~~
Checks whether the given 'state' (a State object) is solved (i.e. all targets are covered by a widget). Returns
True (solved) or False (not solved).


~~~~~
render(state)
~~~~~
Prints a graphical representation of the given 'state' (a State object) to the terminal.


**state.py**

This file contains a class representing a BeeBot environment state. You should make use of this class and its functions
in your solver. You may add your own code to this class (e.g. get_successors function, get_heuristic function, etc), but
should avoid removing or renaming existing variables and functions to ensure Tester functions correctly.

~~~~~
__init__(self, environment, BEE_posit, BEE_orient, widget_centres, widget_orients, force_valid=True)
~~~~~
Constructs a game environment state. Refer to the docstring for this method for information on the arguments taken
by this method.


**constants.py**

This file contains constants used by the Environment and State classes. It may be helpful to import this file into
your solver.


**play.py**

Running this file launches an interactive environment simulation. Becoming familiar with the environment mechanics may
be helpful in designing your solution.

The script takes 1 argument, input_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the
testcases directory). e.g.

**play_game.py**

Running this file launches an interactive environment simulation with a GUI. Player actions are bound to the game window.

The script takes 1 argument, input_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the
testcases directory). e.g.
`python3 play_game.py testcases/ex1.txt`

~~~~~
$ python play_game.py testcases/example.txt
~~~~~

When prompted for an action, press W to move the BEE forward, S to move the BEE in reverse, A to turn the BEE
left (counterclockwise) and D to turn the BEE right (clockwise). Use Q to exit the simulation, and R to reset the
environment to the initial configuration.


**solution.py**

This file is a template you should use to implement your solution.

You should implement the `solve_ucs()` and `solve_a_star()` functions as well as any initialisation or helper functions
you require.
You can test your solution by running `tester.py`.


Note that your heuristic function used in A* search must be implemented in the `compute_heuristic` method and called from your A* method, and any pre-processing-based heuristics should be implemented in `preprocess_heuristic` (optional). This enables consistent evaluation of your heuristic functions, independent of your A* implementation.

**tester.py** 

Use this script to evaluate your solution. This script calls your implementations of `solve_ucs()` and `solve_a_star()` 
in `solution.py`. Use command line arguments to select whether to evaluate UCS, A*, or both methods, and the numbers of
the testcases you wish to evaluate on.

Usage:
~~~~~
$ python tester.py [search_type] [testcases] [-v (optional)]
    search_type = 'ucs', 'a_star' or 'both'
    testcases = a comma separated list of numbers (e.g. '1,3,4')
    if -v is specified, the solver's trajectory will be visualised
~~~~~
  
Example use:   
To test UCS on testcase 1 with no visualisation run:
`python tester.py ucs 1` 

Adding -v flag will run your solution in the ASCII version of the game.

**tester_gui.py**

The usage and functionality are identical to tester.py. When run with the -v flag, it launches the game GUI and animates the search solution.

Example usage: `python tester_gui.py ucs 3 -v`

**testcases**

A directory containing input files which can be used to evaluate your solution.

The format of a testcase file is:
~~~~~
num_rows, num_cols
cost_tgt
time_tgt UCS, time_tgt A*
nodes_expanded_tgt UCS, nodes_expanded_tgt A*
hex grid data (row 1)
...
hex grid data (row num_rows)
~~~~~

Testcase files can contain comments, starting with '#', which are ignored by the input file parser.
